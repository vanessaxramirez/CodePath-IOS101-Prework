## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My Favorite Apps
Blackbox:
    - uses the UI of the IPhone to create a strategic game that makes you think outside of the box
    - has a very cool design with lots of ways to interact
Google Calendar:
    - I enjoy the way you can organize different categories with colors and labels
    - the ability to use across different platforms
Spotify:
    - ability to have light and dark mode
    - friends able to see your playlists 
    - curated playlists with new music

Ideas for App Project:
One idea I have is similar to my favorite app Blackbox. I think it would be fun to utalize the features and functionalities of a phone to pass levels. One level I had was connecting the app to the weather app on our phones and only allowing you to pass on a day that it's raining. Another idea I had was to use the music player to pass a level. Creating a whole game might be a bit too ambitious for this course but it is something I'm interested in doing in the future. 
I'd also be interested in creating a budgeting app that tracks peoples income and can easily show how their money is being spent and where. It would also be useful to show them what milestones they should be at at certain points in their life. (this could be subjective, but I think to live comfortably after retirement people should have an idea of where they should be as their going through life to not have to work till they die) The app would also have tons of digestable information from multiple souces, so people can choose which direction they want to go with their money. 


## Notes

I've never used swift before or Xcode to create an ios app, so learning the interface was a bit of a learning curve.
